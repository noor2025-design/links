        This collection explores the layered life, history, and culture of Hong
        Kong through moments that shape everyday experience. It brings together
        the infrastructures that move the city, including the history of trams
        and ferries and the constant rhythm of the city, which structure how
        people navigate urban life. Alongside these systems are long-standing
        cultural practices such as bamboo scaffolding and feng shui, reflecting
        deeply ingrained ways of building, organizing, and living in the city.
        The collection reflects everyday rituals and pauses within the city,
        from mahjong games and weekend hikes to the shared language of food. It
        confronts Hong Kong's social realities, including cage homes, the
        widening wealth gap, and scenes from recent protests that reveal ongoing
        tensions around identity, inequality, and belonging. Together, these
        materials present Hong Kong as a city defined by contrast, resilience,
        and the overlapping rhythms of movement, tradition, and daily survival.
