     <h1>Life, History and Culture in Hong Kong</h1>
     </section>

     <section class="intro-text">
    <p>
      This collection explores the layered life, history, and culture of Hong
      Kong through moments that shape everyday experience. It brings together
      the infrastructures that move the city, including the history of trams and
      ferries and the constant rhythm of the city, which structure
      how people navigate urban life. Alongside these systems are long-standing
      cultural practices such as bamboo scaffolding and feng shui, reflecting
      deeply ingrained ways of building, organizing, and living in the city. The
      collection reflects everyday rituals and pauses within the city, from
      mahjong games and weekend hikes to the shared language of food. It
      confronts Hong Kong's social realities, including cage homes, the widening
      wealth gap, and scenes from recent protests that reveal ongoing tensions
      around identity, inequality, and belonging. Together, these materials
      present Hong Kong as a city defined by contrast, resilience, and the
      overlapping rhythms of movement, tradition, and daily survival.
